      <h1>Zero-G</h1>
      <p>With any casual thought about space, you've likely only thought about gravity in the context that... well, there's effectively none up there, and not much deeper than that. However, for long-term spaceflights it's important to take into account- especially since we developed as a species under the constant influence of gravity- so what happens when a species that's <i>always</i> been under the effects of gravity <i>no longer is?</i></p>

      <h2>The Effects</h2>
      <p>An extended lack of gravity can lead to various health issues for astronauts— some temporary, some permanent. For example: Bone density, not only is it temporarily reduced during longer expeditions, but they permanently lose some as well. This is called “Osteoporosis” (the loss of bone density).</p>

      <p>It's also hard for astronauts to maintain their fitness. Normally, on earth, our muscles are holding us up against gravity, and that load <i>(while not enough to maintain muscle mass alone)</i> helps massively with keeping our muscles strong enough to support us. Without gravity, though, that load isn't there anymore, our muscles are used less, and we have to do more to keep them from atrophying.</p>

      <h2>What can we do about it?</h2>
      <p>This is where our solution comes in: Centrifugal force. Under a sufficient amount of spin, you can 
      <!-- Planning to put a video from Annaji here, of the centrifuge spinning. -->
      
      <p>This may have some other consequences though, like needing to adapt rockets to be able to do this sort of thing. The most efficient shape for a centrifugal ship would be a ring- however, the rotations might throw off the ship’s movement in space, which needs to be taken into account. Presumably,</p>
