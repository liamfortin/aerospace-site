However, for long-term spaceflights it's important to take into account- especially since we developed as a species under the constant influence of gravity- so what happens when a species that's <i>always</i> been under the effects of gravity <i>no longer is?</i></p></td>

      <h2>The Effects</h2>
      <p>An extended lack of gravity can lead to various health issues for astronauts— some temporary, some permanent. For example: Bone density, not only is it temporarily reduced during longer expeditions, but they permanently lose some as well. This is called “Osteoporosis” (the loss of bone density).</p>

      <p>It's also hard for astronauts to maintain their fitness. Normally, on earth, our muscles are holding us up against gravity, and that load <i>(while not enough to maintain muscle mass alone)</i> helps massively with keeping our muscles strong enough to support us. Without gravity, though, that load isn't there anymore, our muscles are used less, and we have to do more to keep them from atrophying.</p>

      <h2>What can we do about it?</h2>
      <p>This is where our solution comes in: Centrifugal force. Under a sufficient amount of spin, you can inflict effectively the same force on a human as gravity would on earth, having the same effects. By varying the rotation speed, you could vary the force inflicted and therefore emulate different planets as well.
      <img src="https://microbenotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Centrifugal-force.jpg" class="centre">
      <p>This could also have some interesting applications on earth, such as centres for people with osteoporosis on earth to live more comfortably, or letting people weightlift in higher gravity.</p>
      
      <p>This may need a lot of planning to implement in actual spaceflights though, like needing to adapt rockets to be able to be spun like this. A good shape for a centrifugal ship would likely be a ring- however, the rotations might throw off the ship’s movement in space, which needs to be taken into account. It would also need some way to be powered, so if solar power isn't enough, it may not be possible.</p>
