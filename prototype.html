<h2 id="firstPrototype">Our First Prototype</h2>

    <p>We first thought of using magnetic suits and magnetic floors for astronauts to use.</p>
    <img src="Media/imageOfTheFirstPrototype.jpeg">
    <p>However, this idea would not yield the best resuts, as the the magnetic field created would not be able to sustain a consistent force on a moving object. The result would be a disaster.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: roman;">
        <li>The cost of adding so many <span class="standout">heavy metals</span> such as <span class="standout">iron</span> and <span class="standout">zinc</span> would outweigh the benefits of having artificial gravity.</li>
        <li>Magnetic materials <span class="standout">degrade</span> in terms of the amount of <span class="standout">potential energy</span> in a given area over time. Replacements from Earth would be difficult to prevent this.</li>
        <li>The prototype would be impractical in the long term, as lots of ferromagnetic materials would have to be used.</li>
    </ol>
<h2 id="secondPrototype">Our Second Prototype</h2>
<p>We then idealized something called a Zero-G plane. These planes work by simulating free fall, which oddly feels like weightlessness. This prototype was cheap, efficient, and reliable. </p>
    <img src="Media/imageOfTheSecondPrototype.jpeg">
    <p>However, there were some issues with it.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: roman;">
        <li>The planes would not work <span class="standout">in space</span> and <span class="standout">creating artificial gravities by simulating pratial weightlessness </span> would <span class="standout">require</span> precise control over the velocity of the plane.</li>
        <li>These planes <span class="standout">only create gravity</span> for short periods of time. <span class="standout">Astronauts need</span> consistent and repeated gravitational simulation.</li>
        <li>Building such a machine in space would be risky since an accelerating design in space could introduce issues with the orbit of the spacecraft.</li>
    </ol>
<h2 id="thirdPrototype">Our Third Prototype</h2>
<p>Finally, we moved onto an artificial gravity centrifuge. This is a brilliant design choice because it involves the use of rotation to manifest centrifugal force, which creates a sensation of artificial gravity!</p>
    <img src="Media/imageOfTheThirdPrototype.jpg">
    <p>There are many considerations involved for such a prototype:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: roman;">
        <li>Simple <span class="standout">rotation</span> can <span class="standout">be responsible for simulating gravity. </span></li>
        <li>Incredibly <span class="standout">expensive.</span></li>
        <li>We made our prototype using SPIKE Prime LEGO Robotics parts to create a layered project that also introduced a charming User Interface (UI).</li>
    </ol>
